    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "      - The paper is about an improved approach to data cleaning. Specifically, the idea of tidy data refers to cleaned datasets where \"each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\" This framework provides more thorough guidance and better practices for cleaning data in a consistent and meaningful way. The goal of going deep \"into the weeds\" of this one aspect is to setup the dataset in a better way for future usage.\n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "      - As Wickham says, \"A standard makes initial data cleaning easier because you don’t need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time.\" Cleaning data takes a long time (~80% of a data scientist's time), yet there is no standard or expectations for how this should be done. Wickham is trying to rectify this issue by preparing the data to make it simple to analyze.\n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "      - \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\": tidy data is consistently clean and simple to use, and if it has been properly tidied, will be a) easy to perform analysis on, and b) relatively similarly organized and cleaned compared to other data sets thus minimizing time required to understand it. However, every messy dataset has different *stuff* going on, and will be complicated to understand and clean because each one will be different\n",
    "      - \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\": This dictates that when looking at a cleaned dataset, you can tell what are observations vs variables (e.g. rows vs columns), but context is required. Two things which could be considered variables in one situation could be observations in a separate (e.g. home phone/work phone as columns could make sense for tracking customer info, but if looking into fraud for those customers, you may want to have phone number and phone type as separate variables for one observation). For someone who isn't familiar with the data, it's important to understand what it actually represents and the goals before trying to clean it.\n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "      - **Values**: the individual items a dataset is made of, usually numbers (quantitative) or strings (qualitative). Each value belongs to both a variable and an observation\n",
    "      - **Variables**: \"all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units\"\n",
    "      - **Observations**: \"all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes\"\n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "      - A standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure, defined by 3 main principles:\n",
    "          1. Each variable forms a column\n",
    "          2. Each observation forms a row\n",
    "          3. Each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "      - Most common problems (quoted directly)\n",
    "          1. Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
    "          2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
    "          3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
    "          4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
    "          5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
    "      - Why Table 4 is messy\n",
    "          - This dataset has only 3 variables (`religion`, `income`, and `frequency`) yet 6 columns. To make Table 4 tidy, you would want to have no more than 3 columns, each corresponding to 1 (and only 1) variable representing the info in a cleaner, more specific, and easier to process way.\n",
    "      - \"Melting\" a dataset\n",
    "          - Taking pre-existing columns which are already variables and combining them into rows. Essentially, taking columns, matching up the observations with a better single variable, and aligning them in separate rows instead. Very similar to making a dataset long/tall, but more specific\n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "      - Table 11 is messy because it has a separate column for each day of the month when day of the month isn't the relevent variable being tracked; rather, we care about the TMAX and TMIN values as the variables, not the day of the month\n",
    "      - Table 12a is molten because it eliminates missing data and made the table much cleaner, condensing the existing data types according to colvars. It is not tidy, however, because the element column contains variable names instead of values\n",
    "      - Table 12b is tidy because each column represents one variable, and each variable column contains values for a single day such that the variables change by day but all other attributes are fixed and only appear once in a corresponding row\n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
    "      - Data tidying is only as good as the tools which create tidy data, so the tools will always be somewhat linked to tidy data, leaving us in a constant loop\n",
    "      - Wickham hopes others will continue working on the idea and develop more tools and frameworks for tidy data. To date, little research had been done on tidy data, but there need to be people willing to explore the idea, take risks (and potentially fail) so that others can learn from those and keep advancing the field and developing a more consistent methodology. Wickham's implementation is very broad, and it can also become more specialized and applicable to different data types, too (e.g. multi-dimensional arrays)"

    "**Q3.** Many important datasets contain a race variable, typically limited to a handful of values often including Black, White, Asian, Latino, and Indigenous. This question looks at data gathering efforts on this variable by the U.S. Federal government.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How did the most recent US Census gather data on race?\n",
    "    - According to a page on [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race.html) (linked), people self-identify their race, and have the option to report more than one race. It also makes a point to separate race from ethnicity (\"People of any race may be of any ethnic origin.\")\n",
    "2. Why do we gather these data? What role do these kinds of data play in politics and society? Why does data quality matter?\n",
    "    - There are a variety of reasons this data is collected. Some which come to mind include demographic data, history, and consistency. The purpose of the census is to provide a measure of who is in the US at a given point, and to some extent, that includes their background.\n",
    "    - Race can play a large factor in someone's identity, and identities could be reflected in where someone may live, how they vote, what resources they need, and more. It also provides an important check to examine systematic discrimination and explore how people of differing backgrounds have/take advantage of different opportunities (pay discrepancy, education level, wealth, etc)\n",
    "    - This data must be of a high quality to paint an accurate picture of the state of the nation: who lives here, and provide some data behind how different parts of a person's identity affect their lives compared to others. Plus, the census is only done once every 10 years, so it's important to have data be as accurate as possible because there won't be another opportunity to collect it on this large a scale for another decade.\n",
    "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
    "4. How did the Census gather data on sex and gender? Please provide a similar constructive criticism of their practices.\n",
    "5. When it comes to cleaning data, what concerns do you have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race? What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why?\n",
    "6. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have?"
